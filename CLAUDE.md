# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## What this repository is

A Lean 4 formalization of both parts of

> M. Audin & M. Damian, *Théorie de Morse et homologie de Floer* (French edition)

— Part I, Morse theory (chapters 1–4), and Part II, Floer homology and the
Arnold conjecture (chapters 5–16).

The approach is **blueprint-first, chapter by chapter**. Every definition and
theorem of the book gets a faithful Lean statement; proofs are supplied wherever
today's Mathlib allows and left as `sorry` otherwise. A result the current
Mathlib cannot even *state* (it needs, say, the `Cᵏ` topology on `C^∞(V;ℝ)`)
gets a blueprint node with no Lean declaration rather than a fictitious
statement. Keeping that distinction honest is the point of the project.

The book's PDFs are in `parts/` and are **gitignored** (copyrighted). Never
commit them and never reproduce the book's text: statements in this repo are
paraphrases and the Lean docstrings are original.

## Commands

```sh
lake build                          # build everything
make blueprint                      # checkdecls + PDF + web + standalone graph SVG
make blueprint-serve                # serve the web blueprint (needed for the live graph)
lake build MorseFloer.Part1.Ch1     # build one chapter
lake env lean MorseFloer/Part1/Ch1.lean   # type-check one file, no build lock
```

- Toolchain `leanprover/lean4:v4.33.1`, pinned in `lean-toolchain`.
- Mathlib is a **git dependency pinned to tag `v4.33.1`**, already fetched with
  its prebuilt cache in `.lake/packages/mathlib`. Do not run `lake update` — it
  would re-resolve and force a multi-hour rebuild.
- A cold build of one chapter file takes **3–6 minutes** (importing Mathlib
  dominates). Budget for that: get a file as close to correct as possible before
  building, rather than iterating one error at a time.
- Several `lake build` runs contend for the build lock. To work on files in
  parallel use `lake env lean <file>`, which takes no lock.
- New chapter files must be imported from `MorseFloer.lean`.
- To find exact Mathlib names, grep `.lake/packages/mathlib/Mathlib/` before
  guessing.

### Viewing the dependency graph

`blueprint/web/dep_graph_document.html` draws the graph in the browser with a
WebAssembly build of Graphviz. Opening it as a `file://` URL shows a blank
canvas: the browser gives each local file its own opaque origin and blocks the
fetch of `js/graphvizlib.wasm`. Nothing is wrong with the blueprint. Either run
`make blueprint-serve` and open the page over HTTP, or use
`blueprint/web/dep_graph.svg`, which `make blueprint-graph` renders with the
local `dot` and which opens straight from the filesystem.


## Architecture

`MorseFloer/Basic.lean` is the shared foundation and the one file every chapter
depends on. It exists because the book's second-order notions (Hessian,
nondegeneracy, index) are *defined in a chart* and only then shown to be
chart-independent at a critical point; the file follows that route exactly:

- `sndFDeriv f x` — the second differential as a continuous bilinear map.
- `sndFDeriv_comp` — the transformation rule `d²(f∘φ) = d²f(dφ·,dφ·) + df(d²φ)`,
  and `sndFDeriv_comp_of_critical`, the tensorial form at a critical point. This
  pair is what makes `hessian` on a manifold legitimate; everything second-order
  in the book routes through it.
- `hessian I f x` — the Hessian of `f : M → ℝ`, read in the preferred extended
  chart at `x`; `IsCriticalPoint`, `IsNondegenerate`, `IsMorseFunction`.
- `index` / `morseIndex` — the Morse index, defined as `sigNeg` of the Hessian
  quadratic form. Mathlib's `QuadraticMap.Equivalent.sigNeg_eq` (Sylvester's law
  of inertia) is what makes the index well defined, so do not reinvent it.

Chapter files live in `MorseFloer/Part1/ChN.lean` and `MorseFloer/Part2/ChN.lean`,
one per book chapter, each opening with a module docstring that states which
results are proved and which are assumed. Most chapter content is stated in the
**local model** (a normed space, `IsCriticalPt f x : fderiv ℝ f x = 0`) because
that is where the book's proofs actually live; the manifold-level definitions
sit in `Basic.lean`.

## Chapter status

`lake build` is green; every `sorry` below is a deliberate, documented
assumption. Blueprint nodes carry the status, and `python3 blueprint/checkdecls.py`
verifies every cited declaration still exists.

| File | Book chapter | `sorry` | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|
| `MorseFloer/Basic.lean` | foundations | 0 | second differentials, Hessian, index |
| `Part1/Ch1.lean` | 1 Morse functions | 2 | Prop 1.2.1 (needs Sard), Morse lemma |
| `Part1/Ch2.lean` | 2 Pseudo-gradients | 4 | 66 results on trajectories and flows |
| `Part1/Ch3.lean` | 3 The Morse complex | 0 | ∂∘∂ = 0 proved from an explicit hypothesis |
| `Part1/Ch4.lean` | 4 Morse homology | 7 | Morse inequalities, Poincaré duality, Künneth's algebraic half |
| `Part2/Ch5.lean` | 5 Symplectic geometry | 7 | symplectic basis theorem proved in full |
| `Part2/Ch6.lean` | 6 Arnold conjecture, Floer equation | 13 | critical points of the action = periodic orbits |
| `Part2/Ch7.lean` | 7 Maslov, Conley–Zehnder | 13 | index axiomatised; dimension two in full |
| `Part2/Ch8.lean` | 8 Linearisation, transversality | 3 | the Fredholm index bookkeeping |
| `Part2/Ch10.lean` | 10 From Floer to Morse | 4 | the two complexes compared |
| `Part2/Ch14.lean` | 14 Differential geometry | 1 | Sard |
| `Part2/Ch15.lean` | 15 Algebraic topology | 1 | long exact sequence; Künneth over a field |
| `Part2/Ch16.lean` | 16 Analysis | 3 | the Fredholm index, which Mathlib lacks |

Part I is complete. Remaining: Part II Chapters 9, 11, 12 and 13.

### Two design devices worth keeping

**Geometric input enters as a hypothesis, never as a fake theorem.** Chapter 3
takes the trajectory counts as an abstract function plus a `BrokenPairs`
hypothesis, and proves ∂∘∂ = 0 from it. Chapters 8 and 10 do the same for the
Floer data. This is what lets the algebra be proved outright while the analysis
Mathlib cannot express stays visibly assumed.

**Where asserting a book theorem of arbitrary abstract data would be *false*, it
is stated as a predicate the data may satisfy, not as a `sorry`ed theorem.**
Chapter 8's `IsFredholmOfCZIndex` and Chapter 10's `IsFredholmOfIndex` are the
examples. A `sorry`ed false statement would be worse than no statement.

### Cross-chapter proofs

Two results are proved in a later chapter than the one that states them, because
the import order runs the other way:

- Proposition 5.6.4 is assumed in `Part2/Ch5.lean` and proved in
  `Part2/Ch7.lean` as `det_charpoly_symmetric`.
- Künneth's algebraic half was proved in Chapter 15 and has been moved into
  `Part1/Ch4.lean` as `brokenPairs_prod`, which is no longer assumed;
  `Chapter15.tensor_brokenPairs` is now an alias for it.

### The gaps that matter most

Three missing Mathlib pieces account for nearly every assumption and for every
result recorded in the blueprint with no Lean statement at all:

1. **Sard's theorem for manifolds.** Forces Proposition 1.2.1 and every
   transversality genericity result in the book.
2. **Submanifolds** as a type carrying its own smooth structure, with tubular
   neighbourhoods and transversality. Without it there is no space of
   trajectories, so all of §3.2 and the Smale condition are unstatable, and
   Chapter 3 has to take the broken-trajectory count as a hypothesis.
3. **Differential forms on manifolds, and Sobolev spaces.** The first blocks
   symplectic manifolds (only the linear theory is reachable in Chapter 5); the
   second blocks the elliptic regularity of Chapters 12 and 13.


## What Mathlib does and does not have

Checked against this pinned checkout, and worth knowing before planning a proof:

- **Has**: manifolds (`IsManifold`, `mfderiv`, `extChartAt`, `writtenInExtChartAt`),
  immersions/submersions/embeddings (in namespace `Manifold`), integral curves,
  the inverse function theorem, symmetry of the second derivative
  (`ContDiffAt.isSymmSndFDerivAt`), quadratic-form signature and Sylvester's law
  (`sigPos`/`sigNeg`, at *root* namespace, not `QuadraticMap.`), Fredholm
  operators, `Matrix.SymplecticGroup`, Sobolev-adjacent analysis, homological
  algebra and homology of complexes.
- **Does not have**: Morse theory of any kind, Sard's theorem for manifolds,
  the Hessian on a manifold, tubular neighbourhoods, the `Cᵏ` topology on
  `C^∞(V;ℝ)`, symplectic manifolds (only the linear symplectic group), Floer
  homology, elliptic regularity for the Floer operator.

## Lean gotchas that cost real time here

These are specific to this Mathlib version and were each hit during the build:

- **`simpa ... using h` fails across instance diamonds.** Composing Mathlib
  calculus lemmas produces terms whose `ℝ` `AddCommGroup`/`Module` instances go
  through `RCLike`, while a freshly stated goal uses `Real.instAddCommGroup`.
  These are defeq but not syntactically equal, so `simpa`'s final match fails
  while `exact` succeeds. Prefer stating a lemma in exactly the form the
  composition produces and closing with `exact`.
- **`rw [f_eq]` where `f_eq : deriv f = fun t => …` does not beta-reduce**, so
  the next `rw` cannot find its pattern. Use `simp only [f_eq]` instead.
- **`ContDiffAt.differentiableAt` takes `n ≠ 0`**, not `1 ≤ n`. Same for
  several `ContDiff` lemmas that look like they should take an inequality.
- **`simp only [mul_eq_zero]` will split a numeral product** such as `2 * π = 0`
  into `2 = 0 ∨ π = 0`, changing the shape of the hypothesis you meant to
  discharge. Use `rcases mul_eq_zero.mp h` on the specific hypothesis instead.
- **`absurd h hn` already has the goal's type**; do not append `.elim`.
- **Field notation needs a syntactic head constant.** `key.fderiv_eq` fails when
  `key : ∀ᶠ y in 𝓝 x, g y = h y` because that is `Filter.Eventually`, not
  `Filter.EventuallyEq`; state the hypothesis with `=ᶠ[𝓝 x]`. Likewise a `have`
  whose type is still a metavariable cannot take a projection — write
  `HasFDerivAt.fderiv hcomp` rather than `hcomp.fderiv`.
- `Matrix` notation is **scoped**: `*ᵥ`, `ᵥ*` and `ᵀ` need `open scoped Matrix`,
  while `dotProduct` and friends sit at the root namespace.
- `LinearMap.IsAlt.neg` is shadowed by a `BilinForm.IsAlt.neg` that means
  something else; derive skew-symmetry from `self_eq_zero (v + w)` instead.
- `Manifold.IsSmoothEmbedding` is in namespace `Manifold`; `open scoped Manifold`
  does not bring it into scope.

## Reading the book's PDFs

Poppler is not installed, so the Read tool cannot render PDF pages. Use PyMuPDF
from the Anaconda Python:

```sh
python3 -c "import pymupdf; d=pymupdf.open('parts/partII.pdf'); print(d[22].get_text())"
```

Extraction of displayed equations is lossy (cases braces, sub/superscripts and
some symbols come out garbled). When a statement matters, render the page with
`page.get_pixmap(dpi=150).save('out.png')` and view the image.

### Chapter map (PDF page numbers, 1-indexed)

Chapter-opening pages carry no printed page number, so search by chapter title.
Printed page ≈ PDF page + 2 in Part I, and ≈ PDF page + 108 in Part II (drifting
to +110 by the end).

Theorem numbering is `chapter.section.item` (Théorème 2.1.7, Proposition 4.4.3);
cross-references use those numbers and printed pages.

## Related work by the same author

`~/projects/damian` holds solutions to the book's 71 exercises — LaTeX write-ups
plus a Lean project (`exercises/`) with a leanblueprint dependency graph. That
project pins Lean v4.29.0-rc2 against a *path* dependency on `~/projects/mathlib4`,
so its Lean files are not directly portable here, but its blueprint tooling
(`checkdecls.py`, `patch_depgraph.py`, the plasTeX config) was copied into
`blueprint/` and its conventions still apply.

## Git conventions

Commit messages here carry the `Co-Authored-By` trailer. Note the sibling
`~/projects/damian` repo asks for **no** trailer; that preference is specific to
that repo.
